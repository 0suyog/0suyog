## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am sunischit, I am a passionate web developer. I have been learning programming for about 5 years. I started my programming journey with python and learned the fundamentals of programming with it. Then I switched to js because I wanted to do web stuff and have been using js for about 3 years now. As a self taught developer i have hit my head across many obstacles and then slowly but surely have gotten past them. I know MEARN stack very well. I have been making most of my projects in it. I am trying to expand my toolkit by learning go as its very fast compaerd to node.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Go
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about git and i can tell you a lot about it
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: dahalsunischit@gmail.com
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I like coding, gaming, anime


I recently made my own implementation of git using javaScript. Its a cli tool so I got to learn about handling flags, inputs from stdin. I learned a lot about how git stores data and makes it basically unlosable once its committed.

I am currently in lookout for a job as a developer. I would prefer a backend developer position ideally in go or node, but I am open for any developer position, So if you are hiring and see me as a fit for your company please do send me a mail at dahalsunischit@gmail.com
