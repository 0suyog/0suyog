## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am sunischit, I am a passionate web developer. I have been learning programming for about 5 years. I started my programming journey with python and learned the fundamentals of programming with it. Then I switched to js because I wanted to do web stuff and have been using js for about 3 years now. As a self taught developer i have hit my head across many obstacles and then slowly but surely have gotten past them. I know MEARN stack very well. I have been making most of my projects in it. I am trying to expand my toolkit by learning go as its very fast compaerd to node.

I recently made my own implementation of git using javaScript. Its a cli tool so I got to learn about handling flags, inputs from stdin. I learned a lot about how git stores data and makes it basically unlosable once its committed.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Go
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about git and i can tell you a lot about it
